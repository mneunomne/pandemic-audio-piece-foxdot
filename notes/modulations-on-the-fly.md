# Modulations on the fly podcast 

My name is Alberto Harres and in the next 30 minutes or so you will hear an audio piece generated from The Pandemic Archive of Voices. 

The Pandemic Archive of Voices is an audio archive constituted by 24 different speakers who contributed 185 audios in 18 different languages. Each of these audios represents a word or expression in the speaker's native language that could translate their own individual experience of the current context of the pandemic.  


The audio piece you are about the listen to is a generative composition that orchestrates all these voices and words into a collective chant. For each voice present in the archive, an individual sound algorithm was developed according to their own specific rhythm and intonation. It is an algorithmic mantra, with no particular beginning nor end, an orbiting poem seeking to resonate a sense of communion among the diversity of perspectives during this time of collective struggle.


Rather than time- or site-specific, this is a language-specific sound piece. The impact and generated meaning of this audio piece is greatly dependent on the listeners knowledge and personal connection to each of the languages here spoken. Voices that can be deciphered trigger meaning and memory, voices that are not comprehended will be heard as simply sound textures. This language-specificity reflects both the differences and communalities of perception of this hyper-event that is the covid-19 pandemic, as if to remember, that we are *all* sitting in a room.



## Summary


“We are all sitting in a room” is an generative sound composition created from The Pandemic Archive of Voices, an audio archive constituted by 24 different speakers who contributed 185 audios in 18 different languages. Each of these audios represents a word or expression in the speaker's native language that could translate their own individual experience of the current context of the pandemic.

An orbiting poem seeking to resonate a sense of communion among the diversity of perspectives during this time of collective struggle.


Pandemic Archive of voices
- Participants were invited to share in their own native language words that could somehow translate their own experience of the current context of the pandemic and lockdown.
- In the last two months I have been collecting audios in this telegram group
- which at this moment compraises of
- 183 different audio fragments 
- in X diffenret languages
- from 24 different speakers who are all also sharing current context in Bremen

- The Archivist: it is a political act to create archive, to create memory and relationships between memories (vectors & data) 

- This audio piece is a *language-specific* experience, where the perception of *meaning* from these voices will be shaped by how much one can or cannot understand the languages being spoken on the audio.

- This language-specificity reflects the diversity of perception of this hyper-event that is the covid-19 pandemic.
A uniquely global context, so closed shared by all - but so multi-dimentionaly defined through language

- The audio piece you are about to listen works as a mantra, a collective utterance of
- nouminous sound
- voices producing reverbarations

- collective resonance

- a dynamic structure of collective thought, of collective resonance

- we are all sitting in a room, confinement, isolation
