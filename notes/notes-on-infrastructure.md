# notes on infrastructure

- infrastructure thrives on potentials
- infrastructure is ever only realized through it's use
- infrastructure must lure into desiring possible futures
- infrastructure is empathic
- infrastructure thrives on altruism but is not limited to such notions
- infrastructure may be critical or disruptive
- infrastructure may connect to existing infrastructures
- infrastructure may hack existing infrastructures
- infrastructure may not reveal itself as an art/design work immediately or ever
- infrastructure is not confined to wikipediaâ€™s description of *infrastructure*
- infrastructure lurks below and hovers above at the same time
- infrastructure is the "native material underneath a constructed pavement"
